The Bempp data structures closely follow the underlying mathematics.
This allows the user to solve problems with Python code that closesly resembled thier
BEM formulation. In many cases, knowledge of some details of the underlying mathematics
is required to decide how best to formulate and solve a problem.

In this section of the Bempp Handbook, we look at some highlights of the mathematical theory
behind boundary element methods.

This section of the Bempp Handbook is still being written and some sections are still incomplete.
