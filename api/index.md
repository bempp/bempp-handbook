This section of the Bempp Handbook gives details of the functionality of Bempp.

The Bempp library is divided into two parts: `bempp.api` and `bempp.core`.
The user-friendly functionality of the library is contained in `bempp.api`, while
the fast computation routines are contained in `bempp.core`.

In this section we focus on the functionality in `bempp.api`.
