Bempp is split into two parts: `bempp.api`, which contains all the user-facing functionality
of the library; and `bempp.core`, which contains the library's fast assembly routines.

In [the first section of this handbook](../api/index.md), we explored the functionality
in `bempp.api`. In this section, we take a look at the fast core of the library and look at
how operator assembly is carried out.
